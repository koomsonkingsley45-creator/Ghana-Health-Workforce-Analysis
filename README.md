# Ghana-Health-Workforce-Analysis

By cleaning raw GHS healthcare records, performing exploratory analysis on regional staffing, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard, I have demonstrated my ability to turn complex health datasets into clear, actionable insights for public health planning.
