# Ghana Health Workforce Analysis
I built this project to master the end-to-end data analysis process. By cleaning raw GHS healthcare records, performing exploratory analysis on regional staffing, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard, I have demonstrated my ability to turn complex health datasets into clear, actionable insights for public health planning.

# Project Overview
For my second project in this data course, I worked with a dataset from the Ghana Health Service (GHS). The main goal was to see how doctors are spread out across the 16 different regions of Ghana over a four-year period (2020 to 2023). I wanted to find out which areas have enough medical staff and which regions are being left behind.

# Objectives
I set out to answer these specific questions using a Power BI dashboard:
•	How is the health workforce shared among the different regions?
•	Is the number of doctors growing every year or staying the same?
•	What are the lowest and highest doctor counts for each region?
•	Which specific regions need the most help with new staffing?

#  Methodology
Step 1: Data Cleaning (Excel) Before moving to Power BI, I had to fix the data in Excel.
•	I removed empty rows that were messing up the totals.
•	I renamed some columns to make them easier to understand (e.g., changing "Reg" to "Region").
•	I made sure all the regional names were spelled correctly so they would show up right on the map.
Step 2: Import and Modelling (Power BI)
•	I imported the cleaned Excel sheet into Power BI.
•	I checked the Data Types to ensure the years were treated as dates/numbers and not text.
•	I created a few simple "Measures" to calculate the Average number of Doctors and the Total growth across the years.
Step 3: Visual Design I wanted the dashboard to be easy for anyone to read. I used:
•	Cards: To show big numbers like "Total Doctors" at a glance.
•	Bar Charts: To compare different regions side-by-side.
•	Slicers: So the user can click on a specific year (2020, 2021, etc.) and see the data change.

# Key Findings
After looking at the charts, I noticed a few important things:
•	Growth: The total number of doctors in Ghana went up from 1,447 in 2020 to 2,063 in 2023. That is a big jump!
•	The Gap: Greater Accra is way ahead of everyone else. By 2023, they had 702 doctors, while some regions like Savannah and North East still have very few (sometimes less than 10).
•	Steady Progress: Regions like Ashanti and Eastern show a steady increase every year, which is good to see.

# Interpretation & Recommendations
Based on my analysis, here is what I think should happen:
•	Regional Balance: The GHS should create incentives (like extra pay or housing) to encourage doctors to move to the "Underserved" regions like Ahafo and Savannah.
•	Annual Updates: This dashboard should be updated every year so the government can see if their staffing plans are actually working.
•	Future Study: I would like to next look at the number of nurses, not just doctors, to get a better picture of the whole health system.
